Operum is an application to unify community efforts for positive change
everywhere. Users can sign up and view a forum of oppurtunities presented
by organizers in their area, track where their friends are going for community
service, and ask questions regarding events.

TO-DO:
  - electronic service signatures (to circumvent the current ineficient use of paper)
  - format signatures to hour sheet (take hours saved on application and create a federal service sheet pdf)
  - qr-code sign-in / sign-out
